One of the challenges I faced with this project was the formatFutureDays function. Specifically, needing to reset the daysIndex to 0 after 6. Originally I had several if/else conditionals, but I knew that was not a good solution. It took a decent amount of time and research to realize I could use the modulus. This reminded me of the first time I did the FizzBuzz challenge.
